# Cyclic-Redundancy-Check-in-data-transmission
Implementing forward error detection mechanism using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Get the input data from the user for performing CRC. Based on the generator calculate the CRC bits to be added to the data at sender side. Append the redundant bit with the message. At the receiver side, check for errors in the message during transmission.
