# Cyclic-Redundancy-Check-in-data-transmission
Implementing forward error detection mechanism using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Get the input data from the user for performing CRC. Based on the generator calculate the CRC bits to be added to the data at sender side. Append the redundant bit with the message. At the receiver side, check for errors in the message during transmission.


The sample output is as follows:

Sender Side:

Enter the length of the data: 6

Enter the data: 100100

Enter the length of the Generator (Divisor): 4

Enter the Generator (Divisor) : 1101

Number of 0's to be appended: 3

Message after appending 0's :100100000

CRC bits: 001

Transmitted Data: 100100001

Receiver side:

Received Data: 100100001

Remainder: 000

Since remainder is 0, hence the message has received correctly!!!
